# Movieisme App ðŸŽ¬
Movieisme is an iOS app that allows users to explore movies, actors, and reviews with real-time data fetched via API integration.

## Key Considerations
### API Integration
- Uses **Airtable API** to fetch movie data dynamically.
- Implements **URLSession & Combine** for efficient data handling.
- Decodes JSON responses into Swift models using **Codable**.

### Implementation
- **MVVM Architecture** for clean code structure.
- **SwiftUI Components** for modular and reusable UI.
- **Async Image Loading** using **Kingfisher** for optimized performance.

### Methodology
- **Agile Development** for iterative improvements.
- **Error Handling** ensures smooth user experience.
- **State Management** with **@StateObject & @Published** for dynamic updates.

### Tools Used
- **Swift & SwiftUI** for UI development.
- **Xcode** as the primary IDE.
- **Postman** for API testing.
- **Kingfisher** for image caching.
- **GitHub** for version control.
